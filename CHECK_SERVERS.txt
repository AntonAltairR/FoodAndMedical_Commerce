# How to Manually Check and Restart Your Servers

## 1. Check Backend (Express)
- In your backend terminal, you should see:
  Express server running on http://localhost:5000
- If not, start it with:
  node server/index.js

## 2. Check Frontend (Vite)
- In your frontend terminal, you should see:
  VITE v7.x ready in ... ➜ Local: http://localhost:5173 (or 5174)
- If not, start it with:
  npm run dev

## 3. Ensure No Duplicate Backends
- If you suspect multiple backend servers are running, stop all backend terminals and start only one with:
  node server/index.js

## 4. Test CORS in Browser
- Go to http://localhost:5173/admin/login (or 5174 if Vite switched ports).
- Open DevTools → Network tab.
- Try logging in.
- Click the OPTIONS request to /api/admin/login and check the Response Headers.
- You should see:
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

## 5. If you still see CORS errors:
- Double-check that the backend terminal shows the startup message after your last code change.
- Make sure you are not running an old backend process in another terminal.
- If you see any error messages in the backend terminal, copy them and share for further help.
