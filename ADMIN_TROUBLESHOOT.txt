# Troubleshooting Admin Access

If you cannot access the admin side, please check the following:

1. **Are both servers running?**
   - Run: `npm run dev:all`
   - You should see:
     - "Express server running on http://localhost:5000"
     - "VITE v7.1.7 ready in ... âžœ Local: http://localhost:5173" (or 5174)

2. **Backend check:**
   - Visit http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.
   - You should see: "RomsPharma Backend API is running. Use /api/admin/* endpoints."

3. **Frontend check:**
   - Visit http://localhost:5173/ (or 5174) in your browser.
   - The site should load.

4. **Admin login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/admin/login
   - Use:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123

5. **If login fails:**
   - Open the browser console (F12) and Network tab.
   - Try logging in and look for errors (CORS, 401, 500, etc.).
   - Check the terminal where the backend is running for error messages.

6. **If you see a CORS or network error:**
   - Make sure you restarted the backend after the CORS fix.
   - Try stopping all servers and running `npm run dev:all` again.

7. **If you see "Invalid credentials":**
   - The admin user may not exist. Re-run: `node server/db/init.cjs` to reset the admin user.

If you still have issues, please copy any error messages from the browser console or backend terminal and share them for further help.
